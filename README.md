# 3D--Image-Slider
Step 1: Create its basic structure
The following HTML and CSS codes are their basic structure. I used background-color: # 07bdf4 here and the minimum height is 100vh. Here the height of the image slider is 20rem and the width is 20rem.

Step 2: Add the required images
 Now I have added the necessary images here. Here I have added a total of eight-piece images. I used a 2-pixel border around those images. Its height and width I have used 100% mean its height and width will remain the same with the slider.

Step 3: Arrange the images at specific angles 
Now I will make a circle by arranging each image at a 45-degree angle using transform: rotateY. For this, I have arranged nth-child () at 45 degrees each. 

The first image is at zero degrees. The second image is at a 45 ° angle. The third image is at a 90-degree angle. In the same way, I have arranged the art image in this way.

Step 5: Activate the two buttons using JavaScript
So far we have only done the design work, now we have to implement these two buttons with the help of JavaScript code. 

Here the next button will help to show the next image and the previous button will help to show the previous image. First of all, I set the constants of the two buttons and the slider one by one.

 If you want to use more than 8 images, divide the number of images by 360. Use that quotient as an angle. If you use 10 images, arrange each image at a 360/10 = 36-degree angle.

Step 4: Create next and prev buttons 
Now I have added two buttons to change the image. One is previous, the other is next. The buttons are background-color: # 00599c and the text color is white. margin: 0 2rem used to keep the two slightly away from each other. Font-size 1.2 em has also been used to resize texts.

                 It’s a very simple and simple design. Basically, I used very little JavaScript to make the buttons work.
